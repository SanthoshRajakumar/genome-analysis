Here, you'll see the efforts I've made to reproduce certain findings from the study titled "The draft genome of tropical fruit durian (Durio zibethinus)". See the menu to the right for the project plan

This lab project for course Genome Analysis (1MB462) based on the paper summary of which is below, as per the Lab Manual:

"Durian ( Durio zibethinus ) is a Southeast Asian tropical plant famous for the sulfury and onion-like odor of its fruits. This species is of major economic value, especially in China. Despite the importance of durian as a tropical fruit crop, there are few genetic studies about this species. This study aims to describe a draft whole-genome assembly of the D. zibethinus Musang King cultivar and characterize important genes and pathways involved in different processes in durian."
